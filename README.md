# randommw: Generation of pseudo-random numbers with uniform and Gaussian distributions


## Introduction

The numerical simulation of the Brownian motion of colloidal nanoparticles needs a source of random numbers. Moreover, these random numbers should have a Gaussian distribution. Computers generate random numbers by specific algorithms. As a result, the numbers generated are not *really* random (they are generated by a deterministic algorithm), but the sequences are (practically) indistinguishable from really random numbers, in terms of statistical properties, and can be used in many numerical applications requiring random numbers. Computer-generated random numbers are *pseudo-random numbers*. 

The choice of the algorithm for the generation of pseudo-random numbers is essential to the success of the numerical simulation.[1] There are many pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) to choose from and new ones are still appearing.[2] Luckily, there are scientists specialized in testing these PRNGs, and specific test programs for PRNGs have been developed.[3][4][5] However, it is not always very clear to the unsuspecting consumer of PRNGs how to choose. Some developers are going so far as to give the impression that their PRNG algorithm is "the best" and all other algorithms are "not good". There is probably some sociology involved in as to how certain algorithms become the standard PRNG in scientific environments such as Python/numpy, Fortran and Julia. The details about PRNGs are somewhat hidden to the casual user of Python and other high-level languages, yet it is important to be aware and explicit about choosing PRNGs.

The diversity of PRNGs in modern scientific computing is a strength, especially with open source code, and any serious flaw in PRNGs for scientific computing will very likely be detected.[6] Also, it is elusive to look for "the best" PRNG, but one should at least find one that is "good enough" for the particular purpose. A PRNG for Brownian simulation can be good enough, while still failing certain very stringent statistical tests. A look in the literature and discussions with colleagues doing molecular dynamic simulations shows that currently the Mersenne Twister (MT19337) is often used. This does not mean that other generators such as PCG64 and Xoshiro256++ will not work. For instance, we have interchangeably used MT19937 and PCG64 in basic Brownian simulations,[7] with equal success. On the other hand, some older PRNGs have been shown to be of insufficient quality.[1][6]

Standard PRNGs generally generate uniformly distributed random numbers. Since we need a normal distribution for Brownian simulation, the initial uniform should be converted into a random with a Gaussian distribution. There are several ways to do this,[8] with the [Box-Muller transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box%E2%80%93Muller_transform) and the [ziggurat algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziggurat_algorithm) being amongst the most well-known methods. Several modifications of the ziggurat algorithm now exist, improving statistical properties and/or numerical performance.[9][10] 


## Doornik's ziggurat code

A particularly portable, structured and relatively well-documented C code for the generation of normally distributed random numbers is provided by J. A. Doornik.[9] It has been tried and tested independently in the literature.[10] The Doornik code was found to compile and run correctly on both Linux and Windows gcc implementation, and will very likely work with other systems and C compilers. By default, it uses the MWC8222 (more often called MWC256) PRNG as the source of a uniform random variable, which is then converted to a random variable with a Gaussian distribution using a ziggurat algorithm. We used the Doornik ziggurat code as the starting point for our development.

In the folder `original_ziggurat_code_doornik` the source code of the original [ZIP archive](https://www.doornik.com/research/ziggurat_code.zip) by Doornik is conserved. The compiled executables from the ZIP file have been removed for security reasons, and the "makefile" folders for gcc have been renamed to emphasize the 32-bit *vs* 64-bit nature of the targeted executables. The file contents have been left intact.

The files necessary for development (`zignor.c`, `zignor.h`, `zigrandom.c` and `zigrandom.h`) have been copied from `original_ziggurat_code_doornik` to the root folder. `zignor` and `zigrandom` have undergone minor  modifications, and were then merged into `randommw`. The modifications only concern the structure of the code, not the fundamental algorithms. A function `DRan_MWC_52()` was added which generates random doubles with full 52-bit mantissa resolution (instead of 32-bit) via two iterations of the MWC8222 generator (see [11]). The resulting 'MWC_52' generator is now used by default.

## Usage

For simple generation of normally distributed random numbers (double precision), only `randommw.c` and `randommw.h` are needed. By default, this uses the MWC_52 uniform PRNG, which should be suitable for many applications. Only two functions are of relevance in this case: `RanInit()` for initialization and `DRanNormalZig()` for normally-distributed random numbers.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "randommw.h"

int main(void) {
	unsigned int i;
	uint64_t zigseed = 10;
	double rval;
		
	RanInit(zigseed);
	
	for(i = 0; i < 20; i++)	{
		rval = DRanNormalZig();
		printf("%10.6f\n", rval);
	}
	
	return 0;
}

```

### `void RanInit(uint64_t uSeed)`

Initialize the ziggurat algorithm and set the random seed for the underlying random number generator. The default generator is MWC_52 (which is MWC8222 with 52-bit random mantissa for floating point doubles). The random seed `uSeed` is always an unsigned 64-bit integer, independently of the specific random number generator. A PRNG-specific routine uses this seed to fully initialize the PRNG.

For seeding the PRNGs randomly, we can use the conventional method using the system time (not entirely recommended in a multiprocessing environment, but good enough for now). This may be done in the following somewhat clunky way.

```c
#include <time.h>
#include "zignor.h"

(...)
    unsigned int zigseed;
    
    // set seed based on time only (good enough for now)
    zigseed = (unsigned int) time(NULL);
    RanInit((uint64_t)zigseed);
(...)
```


### `double DRanNormalZig(void)`

Calculate and return the next random number in the normally distributed sequence.


## Development environment and compilation 

At present, the development will use `gcc` exclusively, both on Windows via [mingw-w64](https://www.mingw-w64.org/)/[w64devkit](https://github.com/skeeto/w64devkit) and on standard Linux (64 bit). The code relies on standard C (let's say C99, for the part that is supported by `gcc`). A single makefile takes care of everything for now.


## Status 

At present, we are working towards basic usage and validation of the PRNG for normally distributed numbers in numerical simulations of colloidal systems. The code is now contained in a monolithic module that can be easily included in a scientific computing project in C.  

Generated normally distributed pseudo-random numbers can be written to a binary file using `genzignor.c`. These numbers have been used successfully for Brownian simulations in [DDM Toolkit](https://github.com/mhvwerts/ddm-toolkit), giving consistent results between the simulation and subsequent DDM analysis of the simulated image stack.


## Suggestions for future work

- Plug in other uniform PRNGs as the random source
	- see [11] for conversion of random integers to useful floating point
	- Any of the fast and well-performing generators tested in https://prng.di.unimi.it/
	- In particular, generators that can perform jumps to allow for parallel streams
- Clean up test programs.
- Add some PNG figures of the plots generated by the Python scripts to illustrate this document.
- Additional tests of the quality of the generated normal distribution. The present raw moments test (`test_moments.c`) by McFarland should already be quite good, but further inspiration for tests may be found [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RcppZiggurat/vignettes/RcppZiggurat.pdf) and [here](https://www.seehuhn.de/pages/ziggurat.html).
- Include programs that explicitly test quality of randomness (e.g., see [8] for feeding output to standard random test suites) and normal-ness of generated normally distributed random numbers.
- [Voss](https://www.seehuhn.de/pages/ziggurat.html) provides a concise and well-structured ziggurat code that may be compiled and compared. The code is actually part of the GNU Scientific Library ([function `gsl_ran_gaussian_ziggurat()`](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/doc/html/randist.html#c.gsl_ran_gaussian_ziggurat).
