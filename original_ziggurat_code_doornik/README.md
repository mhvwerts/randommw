# Original `ziggurat_code` by J. A. Doornik (2005)

For conservation and reference purposes, the contents of the original source code archive ([`ziggurat_code.zip`](https://www.doornik.com/research/ziggurat_code.zip)) provided by [J. A. Doornik](https://www.doornik.com/research.html) is included in this subdirectory. 

The contents of all source files from the archive have been left fully intact. As of 2024, the project can still be easily compiled using the appropriate makefile. This README file was added. The compiled executables that were in the original ZIP file have been removed for security reasons, and the "makefile" folders for gcc have been renamed to emphasize the 32-bit *vs* 64-bit nature of the targeted executables.
